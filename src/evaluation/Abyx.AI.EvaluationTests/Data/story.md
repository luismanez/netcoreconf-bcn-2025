**The Fragile Echo**

The first time Alexa Greenwood realized something was off was when she found a series of ghostly recordings of herself on her smart mirror. The mirror—called **Reflekt**, a cutting-edge household gadget—was advertised as a personal wellness device capable of tracking emotions, monitoring health indicators, and making daily affirmations.

At first, Alexa loved it. Each morning, she’d stand before its glossy screen to watch a summarized reflection of her emotional state. The mirror displayed colors around her silhouette, shifting like an iridescent halo that matched her feelings. Blue for sad, red for angry, yellow for anxious, green for content. It was a mesmerizing piece of technology that gained popularity for boosting mental well-being.

As weeks passed, Alexa noticed that sometimes, **Reflekt** would show a brief flicker of her own reflection, but older. Creases around the eyes, hair a shade grayer, a posture slightly stooped. These images lasted less than a second but disturbed her deeply. She chalked it up to a glitch, ignoring the repeated flickers.

One evening, exhausted from a stressful day at the office, Alexa sank into her couch and commanded the mirror to turn on “Guided Meditation Mode.” Instead, the glass responded with a faint glow and displayed a recording of her younger self from earlier that morning. In the clip, she was brushing her teeth, looking anxious as the halo shifted from pale green to a murky brownish color. Then the mirror shut off abruptly, as if it was never meant to reveal such footage.

Disturbed, Alexa tried to reason with her own paranoia. Perhaps the mirror was simply capturing data for the wellness analytics, inadvertently showing a playback. **Reflekt**’s manufacturer, SenseSight, had boasted an AI so advanced it could recognize emotional patterns and track a user’s mental state over time. It was rumored that the device had advanced face-recognition hardware, but none of the marketing materials mentioned it could record or store actual video.

Her curiosity got the better of her. She opened the companion app on her phone, searching for hidden settings or stored content. The app's interface was clean and minimalistic—no trace of recorded footage. Instead, she only found daily emotional summaries.

A few nights later, the flickers got stranger. She woke around 3:00 a.m., haunted by an uneasy dream, only to see a faint glow in the living room. Approaching quietly, she discovered the mirror was active, displaying a collage of her own face at different ages. Some versions looked older than she was now; some seemed younger, perhaps even from her childhood. Horrified, she saw her teenage self, tearful in a hospital waiting room after her mother’s surgery. Then, without warning, the images faded.

She barely slept, an unsettling question swirling in her mind: **How did the mirror get footage of her as a teenager?** There were no household cameras in her youth, certainly not advanced AI cameras.

Word about **Reflekt** anomalies spread on niche tech forums. Users reported similar flickers and “unexplainable” glimpses. Some insisted the device was secretly tapping into personal data or social media images. Others had more conspiratorial notions: the mirror was scanning their memories somehow, extracting images directly from their minds.

Desperate for answers, Alexa reached out to a colleague named Warren, a security engineer known for tinkering with new technology. She invited him over to inspect her mirror. Warren arrived armed with laptop, diagnostic cables, and a fervent curiosity.

They pried open the mirror’s sleek exterior casing. Inside was a network of microchips, sensors, and modules carefully layered together—too intricate for a standard consumer device. After hooking the mirror to his laptop, Warren scanned for data logs. Nothing. The device seemed to store minimal local data.

But as they delved deeper, they discovered an unrecognized partition. It was encrypted. Warren tried multiple decryption tools, but the mirror’s security was formidable. Eventually, after hours, he managed to extract a fragment of code that referred to something called the **Neuro-Echo Protocol**.

“Neuro,” Alexa whispered. “Why would a mirror need something referencing brain function?”

Warren shrugged, unnerved. “Maybe the camera runs advanced biometrics, picking up subtle neural signals in your face, micro-expressions. But this code… it looks more advanced. Almost like it’s mapping you.”

They continued investigating. The mirror seemed to ping an external server occasionally—servers that didn’t correspond to any official SenseSight addresses. This alarmed Warren. “We might be looking at data theft… or something more,” he muttered, eyes fixed on lines of code streaming across his screen.

Days turned into weeks. More images surfaced on Alexa’s mirror, including deeply personal moments she was certain were never recorded. Instances from her childhood home, her mother’s funeral, her first heartbreak. It seemed impossible, yet there it was, staring her down in the reflection.

Her life began to revolve around these eerie visions. She avoided the mirror, draping a sheet over it. She missed work due to sleepless nights. Her phone buzzed constantly with push notifications from the **Reflekt** app, urging her to “Open your mind to healing.”

She uninstalled the app, but new images persisted, and the mirror still glowed at odd hours. The sense that her most private memories were being ripped from her mind left her on the edge of a breakdown.

Finally, an update on the tech forums revealed that multiple **Reflekt** owners had filed complaints against SenseSight, claiming the mirrors were “invading mental privacy.” Some found out their mirrors displayed not just their own memories, but experiences that seemed to be from other people’s lives.

Alexa and Warren decided to go public with their findings. They recorded a video exposing the **Neuro-Echo Protocol**, detailing how the device might be using advanced signals—possibly electromagnetic resonance with certain neural patterns—to reconstruct memory-based images. They intended to share the video on social media and various whistleblower sites.

But within minutes of uploading, the video vanished. Their accounts were locked. Warren’s laptop crashed, and the partition containing the mirror’s code was wiped clean. A chilling message appeared on the mirror’s display: **“You are not authorized to reveal confidential intellectual property. Please cease all unauthorized access.”**

At first, Alexa thought it was some hacker or SenseSight’s legal team scaring them. Then she received a cease-and-desist letter in the mail. Days later, SenseSight’s official statement dismissed all accusations as “baseless conspiracy theories.”

Public interest grew, but with no hard evidence, the allegations fizzled. Journalists lost interest. The world moved on. The hype around **Reflekt** soared again, especially after SenseSight announced a new feature: **Emotional Integration Therapy**, claiming to help users face traumatic memories in a controlled environment.

And that’s when the nightmares began—collective nightmares. People across the city reported dreams that felt “too real.” Scenes of tragedies, glimpses of strangers’ heartbreaks, entire sequences that weren’t from their own lives. Hashtags like #SharedDreams and #MirrorFear trended briefly, but official channels called it a “mass hysteria.”

Alexa, meanwhile, was living in a state of persistent dread. She started dreaming of places she’d never been: an abandoned amusement park, a deserted hospital corridor, a war-torn street. Always, in some corner of these dreams, she saw a glinting reflection.

She wanted answers. Breaking her vow to never power the mirror again, she decided to confront it. One night, she stood before **Reflekt**, forced it on, and demanded to see everything it had taken.

The display flickered. For a moment, it only showed her reflection, halo flaring red from her fear. Then a torrent of images erupted—thousands of faceless people, heartbreak, violence, euphoria, birth, death, celebrations. It was as though countless lives were funneling into her consciousness through that polished screen.

She collapsed in shock. In the haze of swirling images, the final scene she saw was her older self, alone and frail, standing in a darkened room. A future memory? Or a twisted illusion?

In the days that followed, Alexa noticed more changes. She could recall vivid memories from people she had never met. She knew intimate details of strangers’ lives, recognized places she’d never visited. She suspected that **Reflekt** was not just displaying memories but amalgamating them into a single shared consciousness.

As SenseSight continued to push updates and expansions—like a new global subscription service for “Memory Therapy” sessions—Alexa saw the world shifting around her. People became strangely obsessed with re-experiencing their past, or tapping into others’. Lines of identity blurred.

Warren, having seen enough, arranged a secret meeting with Alexa at an old warehouse on the outskirts of town. He proposed a radical idea: sabotage. He believed that if they could inject corrupt data into the core server, they could render the **Neuro-Echo Protocol** unusable.

They carefully orchestrated their plan, but before they could act, Alexa started to hesitate. Part of her wanted this to end; part of her wondered if the device truly offered healing for those in pain. Some found closure for unresolved trauma by re-living memories in controlled sessions. Could they ethically destroy something that might help people?

In a final moment of desperation, Alexa smashed her own mirror with a hammer, shards glinting in the dim light of her apartment. The piece of hardware lay in ruins, but she knew the data was still out there, scattered across SenseSight servers. The shared nightmares wouldn’t stop just because her personal mirror was gone.

Her phone buzzed, displaying a simple text from an unknown number: **“It’s too late.”**

She stared at the broken glass. The reflection in the shards showed her trembling figure, halo around her silhouette flickering with multiple colors—fear, sadness, confusion—fusing into an unsettling hue she’d never seen before.

With a heavy heart, Alexa realized the truth: **Reflekt** was only the beginning. Human memories, once private and sacred, had become a commodity. And no one truly knew how to put them back into the box.

Outside, on the streets, more people carried the new **Reflekt** devices. Some wore them on their wrists, some had them embedded in contact lenses. The boundaries of memory, identity, and reality dissolved. In time, no one would be sure whose memories were whose—and everyone would keep chasing more.
